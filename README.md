    Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
    Create a Logistic Regression Model based on the train data using `train_test_split`
    Analyze and summarize key insights of the class report of y upon completion of the regression model.

# credit-risk-classification
credit_risk_classification.ipynb and lending_data.csv were used to complete the tasks.
`lending_data.csv` contains the data.
`Credit_Risk/credit_risk_classification.ipynb` is the scrypt.
